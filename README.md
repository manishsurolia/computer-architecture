This repository is to learn about computer architecture in general. Most of the
examples/solutions given in this repository are related to MIPS architecture.

Below definition is taken from a wiki page for MIPS.

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a reduced
instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA)[2], developed
by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States.

The contents in this repository is just my understanding/notes of the subject.
Hence, there may be issues with the examples given here. For reliable
